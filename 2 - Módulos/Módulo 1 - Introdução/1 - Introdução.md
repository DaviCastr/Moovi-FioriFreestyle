- Where to start?
- SAP Fiori was launched by SAP to provide a new user experience (UX) when using transactional SAP applications.
- Traditional SAP applications are accessed via SAP GUI, such as creating sales orders or creating materials.
- Fiori aims to take these transactions and provide a more user-friendly interface.
- SAP Fiori allows users to create sales orders through a web browser, smartphone, or tablet, increasing productivity.
- End users don't need in-depth knowledge of SAP system processes.
- There are more than 10,000 standard Fiori apps available from SAP.
- These apps are role-based, meaning users only have access to apps relevant to their responsibilities.
- For example, a sales team has access to apps related to sales, while logistics has access to their specific apps.
- Provides commercial functions in real-time, accessible via mobile devices.
- Many apps allow users to start a process on desktops/laptops and continue on a smartphone or tablet.
- Users can check the status of orders, requests, or approvals without needing a desktop or SAP GUI.
- Example: A manager can approve a request on their phone while commuting, without opening a laptop due to security concerns.
- SAP Fiori provides a dynamic experience for the end user.
- In many cases, it eliminates the need for desktops in transactions and tasks performed in an SAP system.
- Work can be started on a desktop and continued on a smartphone or tablet, depending on the process.
- SAP Fiori was launched around 2013 to replace existing web applications.
- Some SAP web applications are based on BSP (Business Server Pages) applications.
- SAP Fiori was launched in 2013 to offer web applications based on HTML5.
- It aims to provide a user-friendly and responsive interface for applications.
- It transforms applications into more responsive ones that can be used on desktops via browsers, or on cell phones and tablets.
- The goal is to provide hybrid applications that function on various devices.
- SAP Fiori offers flexibility and a user-friendly visualization and utilization for the end user.
