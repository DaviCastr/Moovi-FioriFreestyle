## 4. ☁️ SAP BTP in the Cloud Service Model

### **🏗️ The Cloud Service Stack**

SAP BTP operates as a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**.

| Layer | What it is | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🟦 SaaS**<br>(Software as a Service) | **Ready-to-use software** delivered over the cloud. | **Gmail** - You just use the application. |
| **🟩 PaaS**<br>(Platform as a Service) | **A platform** providing tools and environment to **build, integrate, and deploy** applications. | **SAP BTP** - This is where it lives! |
| **🟥 IaaS**<br>(Infrastructure as a Service) | **Fundamental computing resources** (servers, storage, networking). | **AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud** - BTP can run on these. |

*   **💡 Important Note:** BTP is **not exactly the same** as hyperscalers like AWS or Azure. It is a **PaaS** that can actually **run on top** of their IaaS infrastructure.
